"""Singleton compiled graph + start/resume helpers.

Long-running service holds one compiled graph + one SqliteSaver connection.
The IMAP listener calls `start_ticket()` on a new email; the Slack handler
calls `resume()` on a button click. Both bottom out in `graph.astream(...)`
with `thread_id == ticket_id`.

The Slack message_ts lives in state, so a server restart still resumes onto
the right Slack message.
