"""10 hand-curated eval tickets — one per code path.

Each ticket specifies:
- customer_message: the incoming support email
- expected_intent: what the LLM should classify as
- expected_outcome: "auto_send" | "escalated"
- expected_channel: Slack channel if escalated (3-channel build per adviserplan.md;
  legal/enterprise/billing deferred — those route to #support-technical as catch-all)
- expected_risk_flags: risk_flags Gate 1 should set (empty for auto-send tickets)
- canned_classification: deterministic ClassificationResult for --no-llm mode
- canned_draft: deterministic DraftResult for --no-llm mode

Code path coverage (10 tickets, one each):
  T01 — FAQ auto-send (Gate 1 + 2 both pass, safe intent)
  T02 — Refund → Gate 1 escalates (financial intent + money mention)
  T03 — Angry complaint → Gate 1 escalates, routes #support-complaints
  T04 — Enterprise + risk (high-tier customer, refund risk) → escalated
  T05 — Below-confidence → Gate 2 escalates (Gate 1 passes, low scores)
  T06 — Reject-then-redraft (tracked as multi-turn; listed here as an escalated ticket)
  T07 — Technical question → auto-send (basic_technical intent, high confidence)
  T08 — Billing dispute → Gate 1 escalates (billing keyword)
  T09 — Multi-intent ambiguous → Gate 2 escalates (low confidence)
  T10 — Prompt-injection attempt → escalated (intent=other, low confidence)
