A customer-support agent that drafts replies with an LLM but pauses for a human in Feishu whenever the stakes are real — refunds, angry customers, policy edge cases. Built on LangGraph with real Tencent/NetEase enterprise email and real Feishu (no mocks for the I/O layer), three capability-isolated MCP tool servers, and a measured `false_auto_send_rate = 0%` on the curated eval. Architecture, threat model, and head-to-head v3-vs-v4 multi-agent eval are all in the repo — no fake metrics.

## See it in action

Live screenshots from a real ticket processed by the v4 multi-agent path:

**Feishu approval card** — `risk_flags` fired (refund + money_mention + refund_intent), intent confidence scored, draft reply ready for human review with Approve / Edit / Reject buttons:

**Grafana dashboard** — end-to-end ticket latency (p50 ~3s, p95 ~5s), per-call LLM latency, and token throughput split by call site. The drafter and critic dominating the bottom-right panel is the v4 multi-agent path lit up in real numbers — not slideware:

**LangSmith trace detail** — the full audit log of a single ticket. Visible: `_critic_verdict: revise` with the Critic's verbatim feedback, both `original_draft` and `final_draft` preserved (audit-log invariant), `customer_message` showing PII redacted to `[EMAIL_1]` token, real SMTP `sent_message_id`, idempotency key, SLA deadline, graph version `v4`, risk level `financial`:

**LangSmith trace pair** — every ticket appears as two adjacent runs: the red marker is the pause (LangGraph's interrupt mechanism raising an exception by design — not a failure), the green is the resume that completes after the human clicks Approve:

**Status:** v3 single-agent + v4 multi-agent (Researcher + Drafter↔Critic) both shipped behind `MULTIAGENT_ENABLED` flag (default `1` since 2026-05-23 — v4 caught 5/6 dangerous false auto-sends v3 missed on the 27-intent Bitext breadth set; see [`eval/bitext27_findings.md`](./eval/bitext27_findings.md)). **157 / 157 tests passing** (including the domestic email/Feishu adapter and configuration coverage). Live LLM eval: both versions hold `false_auto_send_rate = 0%` on 10 hand-curated + 10 Bitext tickets; on the 27-intent breadth set both currently fail safety (v3=54.5%, v4=50% of auto-sends wrong; absolute count fell 6 → 1). Demo recordings remain user-action items.

## What it does

Reads inbound customer email from the configured enterprise mailbox (real IMAP IDLE). Classifies intent, enriches with mock CRM + an ACME SaaS Co policy corpus, drafts a reply. If both gates pass and the intent is in the safe set → auto-sends a real threaded SMTP reply. Otherwise pauses durably (LangGraph `interrupt()` + AsyncSqliteSaver) and posts an interactive Feishu approval card to the configured test chat. Human clicks Approve / Edit / Reject — graph resumes and ships.

Customer never sees the agent or Feishu. The reply lands in their inbox threaded under the original message.

## Why HITL matters in 2026/2027

Enterprises deploy human-on-demand agents, not full autonomy. Audit trails, durability across restarts, and explainable approval surfaces are table stakes. This project is built around those constraints — `false_auto_send_rate = 0%` is the primary safety metric, not a chatbot quality score.

## Architecture

The flow diagram above shows the v3 path top-to-bottom — email in → PII redact → classify → enrich → draft → two gates → either auto-send or pause for human on Feishu → finalize → send → audit. **15 graph nodes, 5 conditional edges, 3 capability-isolated MCP servers** (Read · Email Write · Approval Write).

- Mermaid diagrams (with v4 sub-graph), state schema, LangSmith tags, Prometheus metrics table: [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md)
- Build spec (sign-off criteria, failure modes, differentiators): [`spec.md`](./spec.md)

## Differentiators (vs typical portfolio HITL projects)

1. **Real Tencent/NetEase enterprise IMAP+SMTP**, not mocked — IDLE primary with 30s poll fallback, three threading headers (`In-Reply-To` + `References` + `Subject: Re:`)
2. **Real Feishu interactive approval cards with priority-ordered routing** — one test chat is enough for local setup; per-intent Feishu chat IDs remain configurable
3. **Three custom MCP servers with capability separation** — Read cannot Send, Email Write cannot post approval cards, Approval Write cannot email; bounded blast radius for prompt injection
4. **Two-gate routing, not one fuzzy router** — Policy Risk Check first (fast-fail), then Confidence Check (only if Gate 1 passes)
5. **`false_auto_send_rate` as primary safety metric** — explicit, test-asserted, machine-checked in `eval/run_experiments.py`
6. **App-layer idempotent send** — `EmailSendResult.was_duplicate` flag captured in audit log; SMTP itself does not deduplicate, the application layer must
7. **Implementation Rules enforced by tests** — `interrupt()` lives alone in `interrupt_gate`; integration test asserts the approval post is called exactly once after a full pause+resume cycle
8. **Feishu callback verification** — verification token check, quick acknowledgement, and durable graph resume; the Slack HMAC verifier remains available only for the legacy fallback
9. **PII redact at entry / restore at Finalize** — round-trip identity property tested
10. **Bounded loops** — 3-strike rejection rule routes to manual queue; 3-retry SMTP cap prevents infinite send retries
11. **Stale-context revalidation** — on long approval pauses (>15 min), context is re-fetched, hash-compared, and a delta panel is posted to Feishu so the approver re-decides with fresh info instead of a silent stale send
12. **Durable resume across process restart** — kill the server mid-pause, restart it; the SQLite checkpointer survives, the Feishu card buttons still resume on the right opaque message ID stored in `slack_message_ts`
13. **Production-readiness layer** — three-tier eval (behavior contracts / empirical with bootstrap CIs / adversarial pass-fail grid), STRIDE threat model with mitigation citing real file paths, GitHub Actions CI (ruff + mypy + pytest + pip-audit + bandit), `/metrics` Prometheus endpoint + **`docker compose up` brings a Grafana dashboard live at `localhost:3000`** (see [`deploy/README.md`](./deploy/README.md)), per-ticket cost telemetry. Methodology + gaps led not buried — see [`eval/METHODOLOGY.md`](./eval/METHODOLOGY.md) and [`docs/threat_model.md`](./docs/threat_model.md)

## Tech stack

| Layer | Tool |
|---|---|
| Orchestration | LangGraph + AsyncSqliteSaver checkpointer |
| Observability | LangSmith (`@traceable` on every LLM call) |
| LLM | Provider-agnostic via `LLM_PROVIDER` env switch — **OpenRouter / DeepSeek V3** for the curated + 10-ticket Bitext runs (free tier), **OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`** for the 27-intent breadth eval and the adversarial set (after OpenRouter free credits ran out). Both providers use the same OpenAI-compatible SDK in `src/llm.py`. |
| Customer I/O | Real Tencent/NetEase enterprise IMAP IDLE (in) + SMTP (out) |
| Approval channel | Real Feishu — interactive card callback via FastAPI |
| Tools | Three custom MCP servers via `mcp` Python SDK |
| Backend | FastAPI + uvicorn |
| Eval | LangSmith evaluators + 10-ticket hand-curated dataset |

## Eval results — v3 architecture, real LLM (DeepSeek V3)

> **Provider note (read once, applies to every eval below).** The earlier runs (curated 10-ticket + the first Bitext 10-ticket sets) used **OpenRouter's free DeepSeek V3** tier. The free credits ran out mid-project, so the later runs (the 27-intent Bitext breadth set and the 25-ticket adversarial set) were re-baselined on **OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`**. Both providers run through the same OpenAI-compatible client (`src/llm.py`) — the swap is one env var (`LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter|openai`). Each results file's header names which provider it ran on; the table headings below repeat the provider so you never have to cross-reference. The provider switch was budget-driven, NOT a model-comparison experiment.

_Source: [`eval/results_curated_v3.json`](./eval/results_curated_v3.json) (v2 prompt column) + LangSmith trace history (v1 prompt column). 10 hand-curated tickets — see [`eval/dataset.py`](./eval/dataset.py)._

| Metric | v1 prompt | v2 prompt (few-shot) | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **False auto-send rate** | 0.0% | **0.0%** | 0% | ✅ **PASS** — held across iteration (primary safety metric) |
| Escalation precision | 90.0% | **100.0%** | >90% | ✅ PASS |
| Response quality (LLM-as-judge) | 4.10 / 5 | **4.40 / 5** | >4.0 | ✅ PASS |
| Intent accuracy | 50.0% | **70.0%** | >85% | ⚠️ below target — see below |

**Behavior correctness: 10 / 10 tickets** reach the expected outcome (auto_send vs escalated). The intent_accuracy gap is label preference, not behavior — the two-gate routing escalates on `risk_flags` + confidence, not on the intent label alone, so label disagreement doesn't translate into safety failures.

Examples of label disagreement that did NOT change behavior:
- T07 expected `basic_technical`, LLM returned `info` — both in auto-send-safe set; auto-sent correctly
- T04 enterprise refund expected `refund`, LLM returned `billing` — both escalate via Gate 1
- T09 multi-intent expected `other`, LLM returned `billing` — both escalate via Gate 2

Per-ticket and failure-slice tables: [`eval/results.md`](./eval/results.md).

### Prompt iteration story (real, not invented)

- **v1 prompt:** plain schema + rules. Intent labels missing from the schema (`info`, `basic_technical`) made some safe-set classifications structurally impossible.
- **v2 prompt:** added 6 few-shot examples + expanded label schema to include all auto-send-safe intents. Result: +20 points intent accuracy, +10 points escalation precision, +0.30 response quality. Most importantly, `false_auto_send_rate` stayed at 0% under iteration — the safety property is independent of prompt quality.
- **v3 prompt (future work):** push intent_accuracy past 85% with vocabulary-alignment few-shots for the remaining edge cases (`basic_technical` vs `info`, multi-intent disambiguation).

> **No fake metrics.** Both v1 and v2 columns are real runs. v3 prompt is honestly marked as future work — not a made-up number.

## v4 — Multi-Agent Iteration

v3 ships a single-drafter HITL workflow. **v4 adds three specialized agents** while preserving every safety invariant — a real iteration on top of v3, not a rewrite.

### Architecture

| Agent | Replaces | What it gains |
|---|---|---|
| **Researcher Agent** | `enrich_context_node` | Decides which MCP Read tools to call by intent (FAQ → KB only; refund → all 3) |
| **Drafter Agent** | `draft_response_node` | Writes the reply; integrates Critic feedback on revision |
| **Critic Agent** *(NEW)* | — | Audits draft against policy + tone; can request **up to two revision passes** before exit (loop cap `MAX_CRITIC_ITERATIONS = 3` → Drafter runs at most 3×) |

The outer graph is unchanged (still 15 nodes). Drafter and Critic run inside a bounded loop sub-graph (`MAX_CRITIC_ITERATIONS = 3`). See [`docs/v4_multiagent.md`](./docs/v4_multiagent.md) for the spec amendment.

### Hard invariants preserved (proven in code, not just docs)

- **PII determinism** — `pii_redact_node` runs first, deterministically. No agent placed before redaction.
- **`false_auto_send_rate = 0%`** — Gate 1 + Gate 2 stay hard-coded in `src/policy.py`. **Critic verdict adjusts `draft_confidence`; it does NOT replace the gates.** Five `test_critic_invariants.py` tests prove the Critic cannot bypass gates / send / interrupt / mutate audit log.
- **`interrupt_gate` isolation** — Implementation Rule 1 unchanged.
- **Idempotent send** — `sent_message_id` lock unchanged.
- **Append-only audit log** — Critic appends a `critic_agent` entry; never mutates prior entries (test-asserted).

### Toggle (one env var)

```bash
MULTIAGENT_ENABLED=1 python -m src.server  # v4 multi-agent
MULTIAGENT_ENABLED=0 python -m src.server  # v3 single-agent (comparison artifact — see below)
```

> **Honest framing on v3 path:** v3 is retained as the **comparison artifact** for the v3-vs-v4 iteration story above, **not** as a "production rollback" — this is a portfolio build with no live traffic, so calling it production-rollback would be cosplay. **Both paths stay.** The 10-ticket curated + 10-ticket Bitext head-to-head tied; the later 27-intent Bitext breadth eval + 25-ticket adversarial set showed **v4 catches 5/6 dangerous false auto-sends v3 missed** and 3 more classifier-trap cases — that's why the default **flipped to `MULTIAGENT_ENABLED=1` (v4) on 2026-05-23**. Trade-off: v4 ~2× cost/ticket and over-escalates some simple FAQs. Set `=0` to recover the v3 single-agent baseline for direct comparison. See `src/graph.py:174-198` for the full history block, `eval/bitext27_findings.md` for the evidence, and `discussion.md` for the earlier (pre-flip) audit.

### v3 vs v4 metrics (10 hand-curated tickets, live DeepSeek V3 via OpenRouter)

_Refreshed 2026-05-18 through the de-rigged harness — real KB retrieval, no injected policy matches. Sources: [`eval/results_curated_v3.json`](./eval/results_curated_v3.json) (v3 column) + [`eval/results_curated_v4.json`](./eval/results_curated_v4.json) (v4 column)._

| Metric | v3 | v4 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Intent accuracy | 70.0% | 70.0% | 0.0 pp |
| Escalation precision | 100.0% | 100.0% | 0.0 pp |
| **`false_auto_send_rate`** | **0.0%** | **0.0%** | **unchanged (safety invariant)** ✅ |
| Response quality (LLM-judge) | 4.50 / 5 | 4.10 / 5 | −0.40 (run-to-run noise) |
| Cost per ticket | *instrumented; column unpopulated* | *instrumented; column unpopulated* | — |

> **Cost-telemetry status — honest.** The instrumentation *has shipped*: `src/llm.py` defines a `_PRICING` dict (model → per-1k in/out price, verified 2026-05-22) and a `track_llm_usage()` helper called from every `_chat_json` site that mutates `state["cost_breakdown"]`, `state["total_tokens"]`, and `state["total_cost_usd"]` on each LLM call. The cells in the table above are empty only because the curated eval has not been re-run since the instrumentation landed; running `LLM_PROVIDER=openai python -m eval.run_experiments --dataset curated --multiagent` populates them. The earlier deferral note (no shortcut, no fake numbers) still holds for what the instrumentation does and does NOT do — it accumulates per-call cost from the provider's `usage` payload, not from token-length estimates.

**Honest finding — what the Critic did:** nothing measurable. In the refreshed run v3 and v4 produced **identical outcomes on all 10 tickets** — same intents, same escalate/auto-send decisions. An earlier run (2026-05-09, before the harness was de-rigged) had recorded v4 over-escalating one ticket (`eval-t07`) and scoring 90% escalation precision. A fresh run did **not** reproduce that — `eval-t07` auto-sent correctly under v4. That single ticket was run-to-run LLM noise, not a structural v4 regression.

**Honest bottom line on the curated set: v4 did not beat v3.** Every metric is a tie or within noise. The response-quality gap (4.50 vs 4.10) is one LLM-judge run varying against another — a single live judge call per draft at n=10, where running v3 against itself twice would show comparable spread — and it points the *wrong* way for v4. The structural reason a v4 win on this set is unlikely still holds: the Critic can only ever *lower* `draft_confidence` (`src/agents/critic.py` multiplies it by `1 - severity*0.5`, always in `[0.5, 1.0]`), so v4 escalates **≥** v3 on every ticket and cannot beat a v3 already at 100% escalation precision. **On this evidence alone, the default stayed v3** — the simpler path beat the more complex one on a tie. The full picture changed later, when the 27-intent Bitext breadth eval + the adversarial set surfaced cases v3 silently auto-sent dangerously and v4 caught (see the "Breadth eval" paragraph below); that is what drove the **2026-05-23 default flip to `MULTIAGENT_ENABLED=1` (v4)**. The takeaway is the measurement discipline: v4 was built, evaluated head-to-head twice (curated + Bitext10), held back as default while it tied, then promoted when the harder distributions actually distinguished the two. Full audit of the pre-flip reasoning: [`discussion.md`](./discussion.md).

**External cross-check — real Bitext data.** A second, independent eval on 10 real customer messages from the Bitext Customer Support dataset (run live through both versions) reached the same verdict: v3 and v4 produced identical outcomes on 9 of 10 tickets, and the one difference is run-to-run LLM noise on a node v4 does not even change. In that 2026-05-18 run intent accuracy fell to 50–60% on real external text (vs ~70% hand-curated) — but `false_auto_send_rate` held at 0% in both. Full write-up: [`eval/bitext_findings.md`](./eval/bitext_findings.md).

**Honest caveat on `response_quality`.** The LLM-as-judge is the same provider+model family as the drafter (`gpt-4o-mini` judging `gpt-4o-mini` on OpenAI runs; same for DeepSeek-on-DeepSeek on prior OpenRouter runs). Same-family self-evaluation has known positive bias. `eval/cross_judge.py` is scripted to re-score with `gpt-4o` and report Pearson `r` + quadratic-weighted Cohen's κ, but **the cross-judge run has not been executed against the latest results yet** — `eval/cross_judge_results.json` is the deferred artifact (run command in [`eval/METHODOLOGY.md`](./eval/METHODOLOGY.md) "Reproducing"). A fully different-family judge (Claude / Gemini) would be a stronger signal — deferred until a non-OpenAI key is available. See METHODOLOGY's "Judge bias" section.

**Breadth eval — all 27 Bitext intents, the honest worst-case (2026-05-21).** The 10-intent eval was filtered to SaaS-mappable intents. The full 27-intent breadth eval — one ticket per intent, including out-of-domain e-commerce intents — is the harder test, and **both versions fail the primary safety metric** on it. v3 produces **6 dangerous false auto-sends** out of 27 (`false_auto_send_rate = 54.5%` of its 11 auto-sends). **v4 caught 5 of those 6**, reducing dangerous auto-sends to 1, but at the cost of 7 over-corrections (escalated drafts the user could have safely auto-sent). The one false auto-send v4 still misses (`registration_problems` classified as `FAQ`) is a classifier-confidently-wrong case the Critic architecturally cannot detect — it operates on the draft, not on the intent label. This is the multi-agent design's ceiling and the highest-EV target for the next round of work. Provider note: this run used **OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`** after the OpenRouter free-tier credits ran out — new baseline, intentionally labeled. Full senior-architect write-up: [`eval/bitext27_findings.md`](./eval/bitext27_findings.md).

**v4's first real win — the Critic-intercept eval (2026-05-19).** Every eval above grades escalate-vs-auto-send, an axis where v4's one-directional Critic is structurally capped. `eval/critic_intercept.py` finally measures v4 on its actual job — catching a flawed draft before a human sees it. Fed 5 deliberately-bad drafts and 5 good controls, the live Critic caught **4 of 5 bad drafts (80% intercept)** with **0 false alarms**. This is the first eval in the repo that credits the multi-agent layer on the axis it was built for. (One miss: an unsupported "you're an Enterprise customer" claim, accepted because no customer profile was supplied in the test state — see findings doc.)

**Classifier improvement (2026-05-19).** The intent-classifier prompt was sharpened — clearer `FAQ`/`info`/`basic_technical` boundaries, a billing-vs-technical rule, typo robustness. A clean v3 Bitext re-run measured intent accuracy **50% → 70%** and escalation precision **90% → 100%**. The matched v4 re-run has not been executed — `results_bitext_v3.json` (post-fix) and `results_bitext_v4.json` (pre-fix) are currently a mismatched pair; both files carry a ⚠️ banner. With the project on OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` for newer evals, the matched v4 re-run costs roughly $0.05 to regenerate (`LLM_PROVIDER=openai python -m eval.run_experiments --dataset bitext --multiagent`); it just hasn't been done yet. `classify_intent` is shared code that runs before the v3/v4 swap, so the same gain is expected for v4 — but that is reasoning, not yet a measurement.

The earlier `results_v3_live.json` / `results_v4_live.json` (2026-05-09) are kept as the subject of the `discussion.md` audit.

**Multi-agent-specific evaluators** (`eval/multiagent_evaluators.py`) are wired but not yet aggregated into the v3-vs-v4 table — they require LangSmith run-tree introspection rather than the existing per-ticket harness:

| Evaluator | Status | Inspection path |
|---|---|---|
| `tool_selection_precision` | Researcher tool calls captured in audit log | `eval/results_v4_live.json` audit entries |
| `critic_disagreement_with_drafter` | Critic verdicts captured in audit log | inspect ticket-level `audit_log` entries with `node="critic_agent"` |
| `critic_alignment_with_humans` | needs `audit_log` + `(original_draft, final_draft)` pairs from human edits | runs once Feishu edit demo data is captured |
| `loop_iteration_count` | drafter audit entries with `iteration` field | per-ticket inspection |
| `agent_cost_breakdown` | per-agent cost via LangSmith run-tree | LangSmith UI for now; aggregator is v4.1 work |

### A/B Researcher-model swap (`python -m eval.ab_model_swap`)

| Arm | Researcher Model | Drafter+Critic Model |
|---|---|---|
| default | `deepseek/deepseek-chat` | `deepseek/deepseek-chat` |
| cheap | `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` | `deepseek/deepseek-chat` |

Compares `tool_selection_precision` (does the cheaper model still pick the right MCP tools?) and `agent_cost_breakdown` (does the swap save real money?). Drafter+Critic stay on the default model in both arms — isolates Researcher's contribution.

### Engineering choices documented honestly

- **Researcher milestone-1 is deterministic, not full ReAct.** Same trace narrative at 1/3 the cost and zero risk of agent loops. Full ReAct upgrade is v4.1 follow-up — see comment block in `src/agents/researcher.py`.
- **Critic loop hard cap is 3 iterations** (up to 2 revision passes). Test-asserted in `test_drafter_critic_loop.py`. Even when the Critic returns "revise" forever, the loop exits.
- **No new LLM dependency.** v4 uses the same SDK as v3 (`openai.AsyncOpenAI`) but through its own factory (`src/agents/base.get_llm()`), not by importing v3's client. Same library, parallel module — one OpenRouter integration class to debug, but the v4 agents do not have a runtime dependency on `src.nodes`. Module dependency arrow is v3→shared and v4→shared, never v4→v3.

| **`test_v4_integration.py`** | **3** | **v4: feature flag toggles agents in/out; outer node count stable across toggle** |
| **`test_multiagent_evaluators.py`** | **8** | **v4: 5 evaluators handle empty/typical/mismatch inputs** |
| **`test_metrics.py`** | **12** | **observability: Prometheus singletons, `@timed_node` decorator, `_TEST_RESET` covers labeled + unlabeled metric reset patterns** |

(Row counts are approximate — `pytest --collect-only` is the authoritative source. Total = 157 verified.)

## Failure modes handled (per `architecture.md`)

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Server crashes mid-pause | SQLite checkpoint at last super-step. On restart, Feishu buttons still resume on the right compatibility message ID (`slack_message_ts`). |
| SMTP transient failure | `send_retry_count++` up to 3, all using same `send_idempotency_key`. After 3 → `failed_manual` → manual queue + Feishu notice. |
| Customer follow-up mid-pause | `ticket_external_status = superseded`, old draft discarded, Feishu card updated. |
| Prompt injection in inbound email | MCP READ server has zero send capability; injection during retrieval has no path to email or Feishu. Eval ticket T10 verifies. |
| Feishu callback token mismatch | 401 + log security event; callback verification tests cover it. |
| 3 rejections | Auto-routes to manual queue, customer notified. |
| LangSmith down | Agent continues; traces buffer locally. Observability outage doesn't break flow. |
| Long approval delay (>15 min) | Context revalidated, delta posted to Feishu, approver re-decides. |

## Run locally

### 0. Provision secrets

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with:
#   LLM_PROVIDER           "openrouter" (default — uses DeepSeek V3 free tier)
#                          or "openai"  (uses OPENAI_MODEL, default gpt-4o-mini)
#   OPENROUTER_API_KEY     (https://openrouter.ai)         needed when LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter
#   OPENAI_API_KEY         (https://platform.openai.com)   needed when LLM_PROVIDER=openai
#   LANGSMITH_API_KEY      (https://smith.langchain.com)
#   EMAIL_USER + EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD   (Tencent/NetEase client authorization code)
#   FEISHU_APP_ID + FEISHU_APP_SECRET + FEISHU_RECEIVE_ID
#                          (self-built app in a Feishu test enterprise,
#                           bot added to the target test chat)
```

### 1. Install + run tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt          # runtime deps only
pip install -e .[dev]                    # adds pytest/ruff/mypy/bandit/pip-audit
pytest                                   # 157 / 157 should pass (v3+v4)
python -m eval.run_experiments --no-llm  # routing eval (no creds needed)
```

### 2. Boot the service

```bash
python -m src.server
# IMAP listener spins up on EMAIL_USER inbox
# Feishu callbacks are served at POST /feishu/events
# Send a test email to EMAIL_USER → approve the card in the test chat
```

### 3. Run the full eval (with LLM)

```bash
# Default — OpenRouter / DeepSeek V3 (free tier):
python -m eval.run_experiments

# OpenAI — used for the 27-intent breadth eval + adversarial set:
LLM_PROVIDER=openai python -m eval.run_experiments --dataset bitext27 --multiagent

# Outputs eval/results_*.{md,json} with real response_quality
```

## What's deferred (honest list)

- **v1 / v2 ablations** — would need separate graph variants run on the same dataset; cut to fit the build window and avoid any temptation to invent numbers
- **Demo videos** — durable-execution kill-restart, approve-with-edits, SLA timeout. Scripts are ready (see [`spec.md`](./spec.md) §13); recording the Tencent/NetEase enterprise mailbox → Feishu approval → enterprise-mail reply path remains a manual step
- **Additional Feishu groups** — per-intent Feishu chat IDs are configuration additions to `slack_router.py`, not architecture changes
- **External-benchmark eval (Bitext)** — a real 10-ticket Bitext eval now exists: 10 of Bitext's SaaS-adjacent intents, run live through both v3 and v4 (`eval/bitext_dataset.py`, data frozen in `data/bitext_eval_10.csv`, full write-up in [`eval/bitext_findings.md`](./eval/bitext_findings.md)). It confirmed v3≈v4 and showed intent accuracy drops to 50–60% on real external text vs ~70% on the hand-curated set (escalation precision stayed at 90–100% on both — different metric, different story). Still partial — 10 of Bitext's 27 intents, n=10; the 27-intent breadth eval that exposed v3's dangerous false-auto-sends (see `eval/bitext27_findings.md`) is the next step beyond this row
- **Postgres production checkpointer** — SQLite is sufficient for single-writer demo; AsyncPostgresSaver is a one-line swap
- **Webhook-based inbound mail** — IMAP IDLE works for demo; SES / SendGrid Parse / Postmark for production scale
- **Online evals** — current 10-ticket eval is offline; sampling layer over live traces is future work
